- Use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter body text to match the original theme

- Use 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) font for numeric displays and code snippets, similar to the original theme's futuristic feel.

- Use glowing, minimalist icons in cyan/green to represent actions and data points, in line with the requested style.

- Implement a grid-based layout with dark translucent cards featuring glowing green borders.
